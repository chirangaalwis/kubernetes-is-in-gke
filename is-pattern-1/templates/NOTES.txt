Thank you for installing WSO2 Identity Server.

Please follow these steps to access the Management Console in the environment.

1. Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

  kubectl get ing -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

    NAME                       HOSTS                  ADDRESS        PORTS     AGE
    wso2is-ingress             {{ .Release.Name }}    <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   3m

2. Add the above host as an entry in /etc/hosts file as follows:

    <EXTERNAL-IP>   {{ .Release.Name }}

3. Navigate to https://{{ .Release.Name }}/carbon in your browser of choice.
